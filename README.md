# HSMM
Home System Media Management - A suite of tools used to manage media across an entire home network.

## To-do:
> Have one central server for easy management (easily installed on a rpi or something).

> Client-side applications for upload and download of media.

> Client-side application for creating new content (youtube video downloader that automatically pushes to the server).

> Biggest problem will be maintaining a level of professionalism and ease-of-use. If it's not easy to use, then the project is dead. First priority is useability.

## Per Task:

#### Server
> Storage that is sortable like a modern music library.

> Easily accessible for a client-side application.

> Holds the media. That's about it.

#### Client
> Possible kodi integration?

> At least mobile and desktop support.

> Needs to be able to, at the very least, download the contents of the server easy (one button. no finicky business).

> Easy setup for end user.

> Extension to easily download youtube videos, and an option to push them to the library.
